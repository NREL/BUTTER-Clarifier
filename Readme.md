# BUTTER-Clarifier

![Tests Workflow Badge](https://github.com/jordanperr/BUTTER-Clarifier/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)

This repository contains a python package of neural network interpretability techniques (`interpretability`) and a keras callback to easily compute and capture data related to these techniques (we call these values `metrics`) during training. It was developed to be used with the [BUTTER Deep Learning Experimental Framework](https://github.com/NREL/BUTTER-Empirical-Deep-Learning-Experimental-Framework), but does not depend on this framework and may be useful to projects outside of this framework.

The vision for this codebase is to collect algorithms for explainable artificial intelliegnce (XAI) in a single framework that is easy to use, easy to read, and can be expand upon. Here, we package XAI algorithms into a module called "metrics", which are implemented as python functions. The return type of a metric is typically a dictionary holding data of multiple data types, such as real values and numpy matrices. Callbacks and any other connector code is provided as necessary in a separate module to make these metrics more easily usable. This project depends on Tensorflow's Keras API, although it would be nice to try and support multiple backends one day.

## Installation

### Dependencies
- Developed using Python 3.11 with pip on Linux.
- Tensorflow 2.13+
- Scikit-Learn

### VSCode Devcontainer

This package was developed using VSCode Dev Containers and contains VSCode configuration files. The easiest way to get started developing this package is to check this project out from Github using VSCode and open it using the VSCode Dev Containers extension.

### Manual Install using Pip

Manually installing the package is also easy. To manually clone and install this project:

```shell
$ git clone [URL TO THIS REPO]
$ cd ./BUTTER-Clarifier
$ pip install -e .[test]
```

### Testing

Pytest should be installed automatically when using the `[test]` extra argument, but you can install it manually using `pip install pytest` if needed. Tests can be run with the following command:

```shell
$ pytest ./test
```

## Usage

### Using the Keras callback
For training with Keras, a convenient Keras callback class is provided. The callback will compute the explainability metrics during model training and can store the results either in memory or as JSON files. The signature of its constructor is:

`InterpretabilityMetricsKerasCallback(epochs, data, metrics="all", save_to_path=False, save_to_history=True)`

- epochs: Record metrics every multiple of this epoch.
- data: 4-tuple with (X_test, X_train, y_test, y_train)
- metrics: "all" is the only supported option for now, and is the default.
- save_to_path: If string, save the metrics to this path as JSON files.
- save_to_history: If true, save the metrics in memory using the callback's history property.

Example of how to use the callback during training:
```python
from interpretability.callbacks import InterpretabilityMetricsKerasCallback

X_test, X_train, y_test, y_train = ...
model = ...

interpretability_callback = InterpretabilityMetricsKerasCallback(20, (X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test))

model.fit(
    ...
    callbacks=[
            interpretability_callback
        ]
)

print(interpretability_callback.history)

```

### Using the metrics module

Instead of using the Keras callback, you can also use metric functions directly. Each set of metrics are implemented as Python functions. They have similar signatures, with the model being the first argument. However, some metrics require extra inputs and so they do not have identical signatures.

Example:
```python
from interpretability.metrics import basic_statistics, linear_probes

X_test, X_train, y_test, y_train = ...
model = ...

# Simplest metric
out = basic_statistics(model)
print(out)

# Some metrics require data
out = linear_probes(model, X_test, y_test)
print(out)
```
